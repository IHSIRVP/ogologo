# ogologo - Constrained Logo Generation

Logo design (and brand identity development at
large) is a lengthy and cumbersome process. The
objective of this project is to allow designers to generate logo concepts faster through a constrained logo
generation model, constrained over shape, colour and
theme. This would allow designers to come up with
multiple logo concepts quickly and easily.


This project is co-authored by Priyanshu Singhal, Rishi Laddha, Rishi Vijaywargiya, Sanidhya Singh and Siddhant Deshpande.
