# ogologo - Constrained Logo Generation

Logo design (and brand identity development at
large) is a lengthy and cumbersome process. The
objective of this project is to allow designers to gen-
erate logo concepts faster through a constrained logo
generation model, constrained over shape, colour and
theme. This would allow designers to come up with
multiple logo concepts quickly and easily.

A Souvenir.
